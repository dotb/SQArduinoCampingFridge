# Arduino Fridge Controller

This fridge controller plugs into the 12v fuse holder of a camping fridge.
It is controlled by a min and max temperature.

The project we used this for is a 32ltr Engel fridge.

##Working
* Minimum temperature
* Maximum temperature
* Switch Relay

Future feature
* bedtime programmable, so that 
 * fridge doesn't turn on over nights
 * fridge cycles down a bit more before going to sleep and stay cool (I hope)
 * fridge still turns on if the max temperature is exceeded
 * sooo much more :)
